            <h2>What we're about</h2>
            <p>
                Code for Akron is a volunteer organization where technologists, creatives, entrepreneurs, governance, organizations, domain-specific professionals, and citizens come together with the shared goal of improving the Akron, Ohio region for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Code for Akron is a Code for America Brigade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our process for improvement is to 1) represent(define) the problem, 2) search for a solution, and 3) implement the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Representation of the problem is a community effort in which citizens, governance, organizations, and domain-specific professionals work together to accurately describe the problem and its impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Searching for solutions is a creative engineering process in which Code for Akron volunteers search for and design solutions with the goal of solving the problem or, at the very least, solving some aspect of the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementation of the solution is the technical phase of development, in which Code for Akron volunteers have clearly defined requirements that must be met to bring the solution to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is probable that many proposed solutions will fail. Our solution may also fail after an exhaustive effort has been put forward in building the solution. In consideration of our volunteers time, our goal is to implement the smallest portion of the solution. This will help in the post implementation phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Post-implementation includes collecting data and analyzing the results of our implementation. The process for improvement is then repeated again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to find the most appropriate solution in the shortest amount of time. We most focus our efforts in solutions that produce positive results.
            </p>

                Circle Back Model
            </p>
            <p>
                Representation of a problem, searching for a solution and implementation of a solution, is an iterative process, known as the Circle Back Model. The Circle-Back Model works when a problem has no defined solution and no defined solution strategy. The Circle-Back Model is especially effective in complex, open-ended problems that require as much creativity as they do analytical problem-solving skills.
            </p>

                1. Represent 2. Search 3. Implement (Analyze, Repeat)
